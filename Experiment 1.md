Introduction to python

1.Aim: Introduction to python

2.Theory: Importing math library to perform variou operation such as addition , subtraction, multiplication, division and performing various tasks such as calculating area of circle and logarithmic functions and trigonometric functions.Implementing if and else commands to find out the greater number.

3.Algorithm: 

MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS

Start

Input the numbers

Perform operations such as addition(a+b), subtraction(a-b), multiplication(a*b), division(a/b) and exponent(a**b)

Print results

End

AREA OF CIRCLE

Start

Input the radius r

Set the value of π (pi) as 3.14159 (or use Python’s built-in value)

Calculate the area using the formula:

area = π × r × r

Display the area

End

Start

Input the numbers

use if and else statement to compare the input values

Display the result

4.CONCLUSION:The mathematical operations , area of circle and greater number is displayed successfully
